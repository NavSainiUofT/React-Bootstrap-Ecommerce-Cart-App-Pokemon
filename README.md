# React-Bootstrap-Ecommerce-Cart-App-Pokemon 
This was an ecommerce cart app created using React and Bootstrap and deployed to google firebase.
## DEMO: ##
## https://ecommerce-cart-app-pokemon.web.app/ ##

## Items can be added to the cart and the cart be stored in local storage so even if you refresh the page, items will remain in the cart. The total price of all the itemas will also show as well as an option to remove the items ##

### On the home page there is a banner after the jumbotron/hero which will randomly generate an item from the mock database of available items and using a React context, the data is presented as a promo with the price and a link to the store
